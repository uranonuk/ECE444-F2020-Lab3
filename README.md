# Lab 4
To build:
    docker build -t docker-sample:latest .
To run:
    docker run -d -p 5000:5000 docker-sample
Notes:
    I used the https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial as my guide for Lab3, therefore it looks different from the example produced in the book. I used my Lab3 website, and deployed it in Docker
